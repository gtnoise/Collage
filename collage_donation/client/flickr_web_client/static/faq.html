        <div id="reqs">
            <h2>What do I need?</h2>

            To use Collage Photo Donation, you need:

            <ul>
                <li>A recent Web browser. Firefox 3, Chrome, Safari and Internet
                Exporer 8 should all work, among others.</li>
                <li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflash/">Adobe Flash
                    Player</a>. Version 9 and later should work.</li>
                <li>A <a href="http://www.flickr.com/upgrade">Flickr Pro</a> account. If you
                don't have an account, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/signup">you
                    can create one</a>.</li>
                <li>JavaScript must be enabled.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="pro">
            <h2>Why do I need a Flickr Pro account?</h2>

            For Collage to work, users of Flickr must be able to access the
            full-size, original images you upload to your Flickr account.
            Unfortunately, only Pro account holders can access their original
            images.
        </div>

        <div id="uploads">
            <h2>How do I upload photos?</h2>

            <p>To choose photos to donate to Collage, simply
            click "Select images to upload". This will open a file chooser
            where you can select your photos. You may select multiple photos
            at a time. Once you choose the photos, they will be uploaded.
            Afterward, a thumbnail of each photo will be shown.</p>

            <p>To support uploading many photos at once, you must have <a
                href="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflash/">Adobe Flash Player</a>
            installed. This feature is provided by <a
                href="http://www.sfwupload.org">SWFUpload</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="modify">
            <h2>Can I donate photos that I previously uploaded to Flickr?</h2>

            <p>You can use Collage Photo Donation to upload photos that
            are not already stored on your Flickr account. It is not possible
            for Collage Photo Donation to modify photos that you have
            already uploaded using another upload tool.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="expiration"/>
            <h2>What is the expiration time?</h2>

            <p>The expiration time is the maximum amount of time we will hold your
            photos on our servers before sending them to Flickr.</p>

            <p>When you upload your photos to Collage Photo Donation, we hold them
            on our servers before uploading them to Flickr.  During this time, we
            search for censored content that can be hidden in your photos. The
            longer you allow us to hold your photos, the greater the chance that we
            can fill them with censored content.</p>

            <p>Due to Flickr Terms of Service, we will never hold your photos longer
            than 24 hours.</p>

            <p><i>The expiration time has nothing to do with deletion of your photos
                from Flickr. If you want to delete your photos from Flickr, you
                may do that directly through Flickr's Web site</i></p>
        </div>

        <div id="tags">
            <h2>Why do I need to tag my photos?</h2>

            <p><a href="http://www.gtnoise.net/collage">Collage</a> users locate photos
            containing censored content using the tags on your photos. If you do not
            tag your photos, then Collage users cannot find the censored content
            stored inside the photos.</p>

            <p>It is important that you do not remove the tags on your photos after
            they have been uploaded to Flickr, because this will compromise the
            ability to locate the censored content hidden inside your photos.</p>
