        <h2>How do I upload photos?</h2>

        <p>To choose photos to donate to Collage, simply
        click "Select images to upload". This will open a file chooser
        where you can select your photos. You may select multiple photos
        at a time. Once you choose the photos, they will be uploaded.
        Afterward, a thumbnail of each photo will be shown.</p>

        <p>To support uploading many photos at once, you must have <a
            href="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflash/">Adobe Flash Player</a>
        installed. This feature is provided by <a
            href="http://www.sfwupload.org">SWFUpload</a>.</p>

        <h2>What is the expiration time?</h2>

        <p>The expiration time is the maximum amount of time we will hold your
        photos on our servers before sending them to Flickr.</p>

        <p>When you upload your photos to Collage Photo Donation, we hold them
        on our servers before uploading them to Flickr.  During this time, we
        search for censored content that can be hidden in your photos. The
        longer you allow us to hold your photos, the greater the chance that we
        can fill them with censored content.</p>

        <p>Due to Flickr Terms of Service, we will never hold your photos longer
        than 24 hours.</p>

        <p><i>The expiration time has nothing to do with deletion of your photos
            from Flickr. If you want to delete your photos from Flickr, you
            may do that directly through Flickr's Web site</i></p>

        <h2>Why do I need to tag my photos?</h2>

        <p><a href="http://www.gtnoise.net/collage">Collage</a> users locate photos
        containing censored content using the tags on your photos. If you do not
        tag your photos, then Collage users cannot find the censored content
        stored inside the photos.</p>

        <p>It is important that you do not remove the tags on your photos after
        they have been uploaded to Flickr, because this will compromise the
        ability to locate the censored content hidden inside your photos.</p>
