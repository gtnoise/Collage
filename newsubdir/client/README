Collage Flickr Donation Client
==============================

This program allows you to upload photos to your Flickr photo album.
Unlike traditional Flickr uploaders, this program embeds small amounts
of additional content into your photos before uploading them; in doing
so, you directly help circumvent Internet censorship.

Requirements
------------
* Python 2.5 or newer
* A Flickr account

Using the client
----------------
Invoke the client program ('flickr_client.py') with Python. It will first ask
you to authorize the program via your Flickr account. Doing so will permit the
program to upload photos to Flickr.

Next, you will be allowed to choose a photo to upload, and enter details about
the photo. To make the photo as useful as possible, please be sure to annotate
your photos with tags relevant to the content of the image.  There is no limit
to the number of tags; providing more tags increases the ability of your photos
to contribute to the anti-censorship effort.

After your click the "upload" button, your photo will be transmitted to
Collage's central server, where it will be stored for up to 24 hours.  During
this time, Collage will attempt to find content to embed inside your photo. Once
it embeds content, it will immediately upload the photo to your Flickr account.

IMPORTANT: Although this program stores content inside your photos, it does not
alter them in any visually perceptable way. You don't need to worry about Collage
corrupting your photos.
